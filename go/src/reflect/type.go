// Package reflect implements run-time reflection, allowing a program to
// manipulate objects with arbitrary types. The typical use is to take a value
// with static type interface{} and extract its dynamic type information by
// calling TypeOf, which returns a Type.
//
// A call to ValueOf returns a Value representing the run-time data.
// Zero takes a Type and returns a Value representing a zero value
// for that type.

package reflect

// Type is the representation of a Go type.
//
// Not all methods apply to all kinds of types. Restrictions,
// if any, are noted in the documentation for each method.
// Use the Kind method to find out the kind of type before
// calling kind-specific methods. Calling a method
// inappropriate to the kind of type causes a run-time panic.
//
// Type values are comparable, such as with the == operator,
// so they can be used as map keys.
// Two Type values are equal if they represent identical types.
type Type interface {
	// Kind returns the specific kind of this type.
	Kind()Kind //对应kind 所有的数据类型
}

// BUG(rsc): FieldByName and related functions consider struct field names to be equal
// if the names are equal, even if they are unexported names originating
// in different packages. The practical effect of this is that the result of
// t.FieldByName("x") is not well defined if the struct type t contains
// multiple fields named x (embedded from different packages).
// FieldByName may return one of the fields named x or may report that there are none.
// See https://golang.org/issue/4876 for more details.
