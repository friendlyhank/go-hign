// FixAlloc is a simple free-list allocator for fixed size objects.
// Malloc uses a FixAlloc wrapped around sysAlloc to manage its
// mcache and mspan objects.
//
// Memory returned by fixalloc.alloc is zeroed by default, but the
// caller may take responsibility for zeroing allocations by setting
// the zero flag to false. This is only safe if the memory never
// contains heap pointers.
//
// The caller is responsible for locking around FixAlloc calls.
// Callers can keep state in the object but the first word is
// smashed by freeing and reallocating.
//
// Consider marking fixalloc'd types go:notinheap.

// this cannot be used by some of the internal GC structures. For example when

// write barrier to be called since that could result in the object being reachable.
