// wbBuf is a per-P buffer of pointers queued by the write barrier.
// This buffer is flushed to the GC workbufs when it fills up and on
// various GC transitions.
//
// This is closely related to a "sequential store buffer" (SSB),
// except that SSBs are usually used for maintaining remembered sets,
// while this is used for marking.

	// next points to the next slot in buf. It must not be a
	// pointer type because it can point past the end of buf and
	// must be updated without write barriers.

	// write barrier assembly.

// This must not have write barriers because it is part of the write
// barrier implementation.
//
// This and everything it calls must be nosplit because 1) the stack
// contains untyped slots from gcWriteBarrier and 2) there must not be
// a GC safe point between the write barrier test in the caller and
// flushing the buffer.
