// wbBuf is a per-P buffer of pointers queued by the write barrier.
// This buffer is flushed to the GC workbufs when it fills up and on
// various GC transitions.
//
// This is closely related to a "sequential store buffer" (SSB),
// except that SSBs are usually used for maintaining remembered sets,
// while this is used for marking.
type wbBuf struct {
	// next points to the next slot in buf. It must not be a
	// pointer type because it can point past the end of buf and
	// must be updated without write barriers.
	//
	// This is a pointer rather than an index to optimize the
	// write barrier assembly.
	next uintptr

	// end points to just past the end of buf. It must not be a
	// pointer type because it points past the end of buf and must
	// be updated without write barriers.
