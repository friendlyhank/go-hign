// objects. A grey object is one that is marked and on a work
// queue. A black object is marked and not on a work queue.

// Write barriers, root discovery, stack scanning, and object scanning
// produce pointers to grey objects. Scanning consumes pointers to
// grey objects, thus blackening them, and then scans them,
// potentially producing new pointers to grey objects.

// A gcWork provides the interface to produce and consume work for the
// garbage collector.
//
// A gcWork can be used on the stack as follows:
//
//     (preemption must be disabled)
//     gcw := &getg().m.p.ptr().gcw
//     .. call gcw.put() to produce and gcw.tryGet() to consume ..
//
// It's important that any use of gcWork during the mark phase prevent
// the garbage collector from transitioning to mark termination since
// gcWork may locally hold GC work buffers. This can be done by
// disabling preemption (systemstack or acquirem).

	// buffers, we shift the stack down by one work buffer by
	// bringing in a new empty buffer and discarding a full one.
	// This way we have one buffer's worth of hysteresis, which
	// amortizes the cost of getting or putting a work buffer over
	// at least one buffer of work and reduces contention on the
	// global work lists.
