	// triggerRatio is the heap growth ratio that triggers marking.

	// E.g., if this is 0.6, then GC should start when the live
	// heap has reached 1.6 times the heap size marked by the
	// previous cycle. This should be ≤ GOGC/100 so the trigger
	// heap size is less than the goal heap size. This is set
	// during mark termination for the next cycle's trigger.
	triggerRatio float64

	// gc_trigger is the heap size that triggers marking.
	//
	// When heap_live ≥ gc_trigger, the mark phase will start.
	// This is also the heap size by which proportional sweeping
	// must be complete.
	//
	// This is computed from triggerRatio during mark termination
	// for the next cycle's trigger.
	gc_trigger uint64

	// heap_live is the number of bytes considered live by the GC.
	// That is: retained by the most recent GC plus allocated
	// since then. heap_live <= heap_alloc, since heap_alloc
	// includes unmarked objects that have not yet been swept (and
	// hence goes up as we allocate and down as we sweep) while
	// heap_live excludes these objects (and hence only goes up
	// between GCs).
	//
	// This is updated atomically without locking. To reduce
	// contention, this is updated only when obtaining a span from
	// an mcentral and at this point it counts all of the
	// unallocated slots in that span (which will be allocated
	// before that mcache obtains another span from that
	// mcentral). Hence, it slightly overestimates the "true" live
	// heap size. It's better to overestimate than to
	// underestimate because 1) this triggers the GC earlier than
	// necessary rather than potentially too late and 2) this
	// leads to a conservative GC rate rather than a GC rate that
	// is potentially too low.
	//
	// Reads should likewise be atomic (or during STW).
	//
	// Whenever this is updated, call traceHeapAlloc() and
	// gcController.revise().
	heap_live uint64

	// heap_scan is the number of bytes of "scannable" heap. This
	// is the live heap (as counted by heap_live), but omitting
	// no-scan objects and no-scan tails of objects.
	//
	// Whenever this is updated, call gcController.revise().
	heap_scan uint64

	// heap_marked is the number of bytes marked by the previous
	// GC. After mark termination, heap_live == heap_marked, but
	// unlike heap_live, heap_marked does not change until the
	// next mark termination.

// restricts their useability.)
//
// A side-effect of using xadduintptr() is that we need to check for
